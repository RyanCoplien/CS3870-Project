# Secure Web Programming Project

This project was a semester-long project in CS3870, where we created a simple HTML, CSS website, then slowly implemented it into ASP.NET and then finally an ASP.NET MVC project. 
There were many goals achieved for this project, including:
* Developing and Designing a website using HTML, CSS, and ASP.NET model-view-controllers
* Implementing CRUD functionality into a website
* Implementing Login, Logout, and Register functionality
* Using SSL protocols to secure a website
* Using cookie-based authentication to authorize access
* Using encryption to hash, salt, and store passwords to a database
* Using data filtering to force valid inputs
* Providing protection from SQL Injection attacks
